Step 1: Ensure/Double Check Permissions on Sensitive Files
1. Permissions on /etc/shadow should allow only root read and write access.

   * Command to inspect permissions: ls -l /etc/shadow

   * Command to set permissions (if needed): sudo chmod 600 /etc/shadow

      2. Permissions on /etc/gshadow should allow only root read and write access.

         * Command to inspect permissions:ls -l /etc/gshadow
         * Command to set permissions (if needed): sudo chmod 600 /etc/gshadow

            3. Permissions on /etc/group should allow root read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

               * Command to inspect permissions: ls -l /etc/group

               * Command to set permissions (if needed): sudo chmod 644 /etc/group

                  4. Permissions on /etc/passwd should allow root read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

                     * Command to inspect permissions: s -l /etc/passwd
                     * Command to set permissions (if needed): sudo chmod 644 /etc/passwd

Step 2: Create User Accounts
                        1. Add user accounts for sam, joe, amy, sara, and admin.

                           * Command to add each user account (include all five users):
                           * Sudo useradd Sam
                           * Sudo useradd Joe
                           * Sudo useradd Amy
                           * Sudo useradd Sara
                           * Sudo useradd Admin
                           2. Force users to create 16-character passwords incorporating numbers and symbols.
Vi /etc/security/pwquality.conf
                              * Command to edit pwquality.conf file: sudo nano pwquality.conf



                              * Updates to configuration file:
                              * minlen = 16 (changed from 8)
                              * dcredit = 1 (changed from 0)
                              * ocredit = 1 (changed from 0)

                                 3. Force passwords to expire every 90 days.

                                    * Command to to set each new user's password to expire in 90 days (include all five users):
                                    * sudo chage -M 90 Sam
                                    * sudo chage -M 90 Joe
                                    * sudo chage -M 90 Amy
                                    * sudo chage -M 90 Sara
                                    * sudo chage -M 90 Admin
                                    4. Ensure that only the admin has general sudo access.

                                       * Command to add admin to the sudo group: sudo usermod -aG sudo Admin
                                       * Check if the user was added: groups Admin
Step 3: Create User Group and Collaborative Folder
                                       1. Add an engineers group to the system.

                                          * Command to add group: sudo groupadd Engineers
                                          2. Add users sam, joe, amy, and sara to the managed group.

                                             * Command to add users to engineers group (include all four users):
                                             *  sudo usermod -aG Engineers Sam
                                             *  sudo usermod -aG Engineers Joe
                                             * sudo usermod -aG Engineers Amy
                                             * sudo usermod -aG Engineers Sara
                                             3. Create a shared folder for this group at /home/engineers.

                                                * Command to create the shared folder: sudo mkdir /etc/sharedfolder/
                                                4. Change ownership on the new engineers' shared folder to the engineers group.

                                                   * Command to change ownership of engineer's shared folder to engineer group: sudo chgrp Engineers /etc/sharedfolder
Step 4: Lynis Auditing
                                                   1. Command to install Lynis: sudo apt-get install lynis

                                                   2. Command to see documentation and instructions: lynis show commands

                                                   3. Command to run an audit: sudo lynis audit system
                                                   4. Provide a report from the Lynis output on what can be done to harden the system.
